/*
 The :: (scope resolution) operator is used to get hidden names due to variable scopes so that you can still use them.
 The scope resolution operator can be used as both unary and binary.
 You can use the unary scope operator if a namespace scope or global scope name is hidden by a particular declaration of an equivalent name during a block or class.

 its usage
 1) To access a global variable when there is a local variable with same name
 2) To define a function outside a class.
 3) To access a classâ€™s static variables.
 4) In case of multiple Inheritance
 5) For namespace (std::cout)
 6) Refer to a class inside another class : If same variable name exists in two ancestor classes, we can use scope resolution operator to distinguish.
 A::x and B::x to refer same variable name of different classes


 For example, if you have a global variable of name my_var and a local variable of name my_var, to access global my_var, you'll need to use the scope resolution operator.

// You can also use the scope resolution operator to use class names or class member names.
// If a class member name is hidden, you can use it by prefixing it with its class name and the class scope operator.
