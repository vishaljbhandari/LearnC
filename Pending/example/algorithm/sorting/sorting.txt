FASTEST SORTING ALGORITHM

Quicksort
The time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n) in the best case, O(n log n) in the average case, and O(n^2) in the worst case.
But because it has the best performance in the average case for most inputs, Quicksort is generally considered the “fastest” sorting algorithm
