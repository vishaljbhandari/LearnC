 C++03 is a version of an international standard for the programming language C++. It is defined by two standards organizations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), in standard ISO/IEC 14882:2003.

 C++03 replaced the prior revision of the C++ standard, called C++98, and was later replaced by C++11. C++03 was primarily a bug fix release for the implementers to ensure greater consistency and portability.[1] This revision addressed 92 core language defect reports,[2] 125 library defect reports,[3] and included only one new language feature: value initialization[4]

 Among the more noteworthy defect reports addressed by C++03 was the library defect report 69,[5] whose resolution added the requirement that elements in a vector are stored contiguously.[6] This codifies the common expectation that a C++ std::vector object uses a memory layout similar to an array. While most implementations satisfied this expectation, it was not required by C++98.
